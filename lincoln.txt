LINCOLN LETTERS

By Abraham Lincoln


Published by The Bibilophile Society




NOTE

The letters herein by Lincoln are so thoroughly characteristic of
the man and are in themselves so completely self explanatory that
it requires no comment to enable the reader fully to understand and
appreciate them It will be observed that the philosophical
admonitions in the letter to his brother Johnston were written on
the same sheet with the letter to his father

The promptness and decision with which Lincoln despatched the
multitudinous affairs of his office during the most turbulent
scenes of the Civil War are exemplified in his unequivocal order to
the Attorney General indorsed on the back of the letter of Hon
Austin A King requesting a pardon for John B Corner The
indorsement bears even date with the letter itself and Corner was
pardoned on the following day


THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THE WITHIN FACSIMILES WERE MADE ARE IN THE
COLLECTION OF MR WILLIAM K BIXBY AND THROUGH HIS COURTESY THEY
ARE REPRODUCED FOR MEMBERS OF THE BIBLIOPHILE SOCIETY
